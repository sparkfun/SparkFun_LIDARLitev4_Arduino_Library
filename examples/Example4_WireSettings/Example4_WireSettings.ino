  This code is Lemonadeware; if you see me (or any other SparkFun employee) at the
  local, and you've found our code helpful, please buy us a round!

  Hardware Connections:
  Plug Qwiic LIDAR into Qwiic RedBoard using Qwiic connector.
  Compilation will fail if your platform doesn't have multiple I2C ports.
  Set serial monitor to 115200 baud.
